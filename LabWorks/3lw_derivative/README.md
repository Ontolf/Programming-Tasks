Lab19 _dervative.  
  
In Lab19_derivative we are searching for values of f(x) and f'(x), with using of analitical formula and forward difference.  There program output's these values.  
  
Example:  

Inputed values:  
a = 1  
b = 3  
step = 0.01 (precision)

In this case we have coordinates(check derivative.dat). Coordinates are forming next Gnuplot's image:
